## Steps

1. Check the [design](https://www.figma.com/design/0JNhHbo4OIqQuiCLSxdxjh/Code-Connect?node-id=1576-2853&t=Up6pp75jtHPrIc4T-0).
2. Set up your project (files and repo)
3. Get font resources and place in your project
4. Prepare global CSS (root, base, font-face, utilities, etc.)
5. Create the atoms (HTML and CSS).
6. Create the components (HTML and CSS).
7. Create the blocks (HTML and CSS).

## Pointers
1. When working on a single block/component, make it responsive before proceeding to another thing.
2. Consistency is key when structuring your website. Keep the pattern similar and use utilities when necessary.
3. When using utitlties and you keep finding yourself having to override it exclusively for each blocks, something is wrong here and consider reviewing your implementation. Utilities are supposed to make things convenient for you as you work through your project.
4. Prioritize the easy things first to gain momentum.
